# Zip-File-Exctractor-Using-Python
In this repository I am sharing code for extracting ".zip" file using python.

you will have to change the zip file name mentioned in code according to your zip file, on which you want to try this code. then put this "extract.py" file where you want to extract the file and run this file by double-clicking on it. but for that you need to install a python on your pc or laptop.
